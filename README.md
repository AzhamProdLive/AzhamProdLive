# Hi there, welcome on my Trash Readme 👋

I'm a french student studing IT & Network Management & IT Maintenance as the CESI Engineering school, I don't really do development for work, but mostly for fun, so that's why most of my repos looks like trash/cringe, but hey, at least you there so that's great lol.
